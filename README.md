# sign-up-form
## Introduction
This is a mock-sign-up-form using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project is a demonstration of form creation in HTML and CSS, as well as some basic validation in JavaScript.

This project was created as a solution to the Sign-Up Form project from The Odin Project's "Full Stack JavaScript" Course.

## After-thoughts
I spent a lot of time at the beginning deciding on a background image and overall theme to go with. I ultimately decided to take advantage of the assets provided by The Odin Project and followed a similar "Norse Mythology" theme.

While part of this project was to practice implementing form validation using HTML attributes, I instead decided to implement it entirely in JavaScript in order to maintain a cohesive stylistic theme when dealing with invalid inputs. I felt that it looked odd to balance both the built-in validation messages with my own error messages, and ultimately decided on implementing them all myself with the help of some regular expressions.
